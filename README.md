# Electric-Vehicle-Charge-Management
Over the last several years, the use of electric vehicles has skyrocketed.
As a result, quick charging for electric vehicles is in great demand right now.
However, numerous Electric Vehicle Power Stations, in order to give quick charging, are damaging the electricity grid of that specific location, and so various measures are being used to conserve power grid, such as solar panel installations, and so on.
However, these systems have a high initial cost, are costly to store energy, and demand a considerable quantity of space.
As a result, in order to give a cost-effective solution to this problem and to avoid uncoordinated charging, we propose using Machine Learning to reduce voltage fluctuations, load variation, and improve power quality and also to make future predictions.
